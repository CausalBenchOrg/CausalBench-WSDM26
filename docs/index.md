## Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirements
Submissions must present original work not under review elsewhere. Concurrent submission to other venues is not permitted. Papers must cite prior work appropriately, including authors’ own related publications.

## Artifacts and Reproducibility
Authors are encouraged to share code, data, and experimental setups. 

## Inclusion and Diversity
CausalBench embraces the values of diversity and inclusion in writing, participation, and representation. Authors should use inclusive language and examples that avoid stereotyping or marginalization of any group.

## Conflicts of Interest
Authors must declare any conflicts of interest with organizers or reviewers (e.g., recent collaborations, shared affiliations, advisor/advisee relationships). Submissions with incorrect conflict declarations are subject to rejection.

## ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.

## Policy on Authorship Requirements and GenAI
We follow the ACM policy on authorship requirements. Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: "The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work."
